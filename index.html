    <h1>Connor FitzGerald</h1>
    <p>This is the way you take out your flustrations. Now we don't want him to get lonely, so we'll give him a little friend. Remember how free clouds are. They just lay around in the sky all day long.
        That's a crooked tree. We'll send him to Washington. Let's do it again then, what the heck. Maybe there's a happy little bush that lives right there.</p>
